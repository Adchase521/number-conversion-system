# Process Documentation: Automated Number System Converter

## Purpose
This documentation describes the process for automating number system conversions (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal) using a Python Flet app.

## Process Steps

1. **Group Collaboration**
   - The project is designed to be developed and maintained by a group of five collaborators.
   - Each collaborator is assigned specific tasks (UI, conversion logic, testing, deployment, documentation).
   - Version control and collaboration are managed via a shared GitHub repository.

2. **Development Workflow**
   - The app is built using Python and the Flet library for cross-platform UI.
   - Code is modularized for easy maintenance and extension.
   - Regular code reviews and merges are performed to ensure code quality.

3. **Conversion Logic**
   - The app supports conversion between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal systems.
   - Input validation and error handling are implemented for robust operation.
   - Negative numbers are supported in all conversions.

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests are written for conversion functions to ensure accuracy.
   - Manual testing is performed on the UI for usability and correctness.

5. **Documentation**
   - Process and program documentation are maintained in the repository.
   - Documentation is updated as features are added or changed.

6. **Deployment**
   - The app is deployed to web, Android, and iOS platforms using Fletâ€™s cross-platform capabilities.
   - Instructions for building and deploying to mobile platforms are included in the repository.

7. **Collaboration and Submission**
   - Collaborators are added to the GitHub project for code contributions and reviews.
   - Final submission includes process documentation, program documentation, and deployment instructions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- Flet library
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Notes
- The process ensures that all group members contribute and the project is well-documented and tested.
- The app is designed for easy deployment to multiple platforms.
